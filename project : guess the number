How to generate a random number in C

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
int main(){
int number;
srand(time(0));
number = rand();
printf("The random number generated is %d.", number);
return 0;
}


Problem
This is going to be fun
We will write a program that generates a random number and
asks the player to guess it. If the player's guess 
is higher than the actual number the program 
displays "Lower Number Please". Similarly if the
user's guess is too low the program prints "Higher 
Number Please".
When the user guesses the correct number, the 
program displays the number of guesses the player
used to arrive at the number.


{   
    int number, guess, nguesses;
    srand(time(0));
    number = rand()%100+1;
    printf("The random number is %d \n", number);
    do{
        printf("Guess the number between 1 to 100.\n");
        scanf("%d", &guess);
        if(guess<number){
            printf("Higher Number Pls\n");
        }
        else if(guess>number){
            printf("Lower Number Pls\n");
        }
        else{
            printf("You guessed it in %d attempts.\n", nguesses);
        }
        nguesses++;
    }
        while(guess!=number);
    

    return 0;
}
